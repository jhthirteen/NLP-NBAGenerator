TODO: Add a function that allows a user to search for three point percentages within a specified range of dates
Idea here --> prompt the user that the player had at least one inactive game during this stretch --> prompt them if we would like the
past 5 games that THEY played, or the past 5 games the team played (including some inactive games in that case)
TODO: These functions can all be generalized to a single function with the data-stat tag being matched up with via some mapping at the beginning of the function.
